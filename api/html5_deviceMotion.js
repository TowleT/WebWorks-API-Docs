 * @toc {Device Orientation} HTML5 Device Orientation Event
 * @namespace The Orientation event is subsequently fired on a window object when a significant change on orientation occurs. 
 * <br>Registration for orientation events is achieved by calling window.addEventListener with event type "deviceorientation". Implementations must only fire events asynchronously, after this call has returned.
 * <br><br>The orientation of the device is given in terms of the transformation from a coordinate frame fixed on the Earth to a coordinate frame fixed in the device. This is typically implemented by combining information from an accelerometer and a magnetometer.
 * <br><br>The event's absolute property dictates whether the implementation is able or unable to provide absolute values for the three angles of alpha, beta and gamma.
 * <br><br>The values of alpha, beta and gamma represent the angles measured as the  device's axes change with respect to some fixed coordinate frame. See {@link RotationRate} for details.
 * <br><br>A device lying flat on a horizontal surface with the top of the screen pointing west has the following orientation:
 * <br>			<i> { alpha: 90, beta: 0, gamma: 0 }</i>

 * Acceleration data is given in meters per second squared and uses the body axes defined in the device orientation event. Acceleration data (without the effect of gravity) cannot be provided when there is a lack of a gyroscope. 
 * Implementations that are unable to provide acceleration data without the effect of gravity may instead supply the acceleration including the effect of gravity. 
 * <p>The values reported are equal to the acceleration of the device, plus an acceleration equal and opposite to the acceleration due to gravity.
 * This is less useful in many applications but is provided as a means of providing best-effort support. What does this mean? 
 * These values can be stored and manipulated in variables outside the event scope. These values can be used to control the motion of objects defined in the DOM by the device's gyroscope and accelerometer.

 * <p>Data Examples: 
 * A device lying flat on a horizontal surface with the screen upmost has an acceleration of zero and the following value for accelerationIncludingGravity:

/**
 * @toc {Device Orientation} HTML5 Rotation Rate
 * @PB10
 * @namespace
 * Represents the Angular velocity of the motion.
 * The orientation of the device is given in terms of the transfromation from a coordinate frame fixed on the Earth to a coordinate frame fixed in the device.
 * The Earth coordinate frame is a 'East, North, Up' frame at the user's location. It has the following 3 axes, where the ground plane is tangent to the WGS 84 spheroid at the user's location.
 * <ul>
 * <li>East (X) is in the ground plane, perpendicular to the North axis and positive towards the East.</li>
 * <li>North (Y) is in the ground plane and positive towards true North (towards the North Pole).</li>
 * <li>Up (Z) is perpendicular to the ground plane and positive upwards.</li>
 * </ul>
 * For a mobile device, the device coordinate frame has the following 3 axes. The axes are defined relative to the standard orientation of the screen, 
 * typically portrait, when slide-out keyboards are not deployed. If the orientation of the screen changes when the device is rotated or a slide-out keyboard is deployed, 
 * this does not affect the orientation of the coordinate frame relative to the device. Users wishing to detect these changes in screen orientation may be able to do so with the existing orientationchange event.
 * <ul>
 * <li>x is in the plane of the screen and is positive towards the right hand side of the screen.</li>
 * <li>y is in the plane of the screen and is positive towards the top of the screen.</li>
 * <li>z is perpendicular to the screen, positive out of the screen.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The transformation from the Earth frame to the device frame is expressed in terms of 3 rotations, 
 * specified in the device frame. Rotations use the right-hand convention: positive rotation around an axis is clockwise when viewed along the positive direction of the axis.
